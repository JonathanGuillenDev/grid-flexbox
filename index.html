            <li>The earliest known popsicles date as far back as 1872.
                Back then, a popsicle was called a <em>Hokey-Pokey.</em>
            </li>
            <li>Popsicles are also known as freezer pops, ice lollies, and ice pops.</li>
            <li>The world's largest popsicle was made in
                1997 and was 21 feet tall. Talk about brainfreeze!</li>
            <li>Popsicles have become so popular that a popular
                arts and crafts item is called a popsicle stick.</li>
            <li>The Popsicle was invented by Frank Epperson, who was 11 years
                old at the time. Cool!</li>
